    "# Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "# Ans:-An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program's execution.\n",
    "# It typically occurs when an error happens during the runtime of a program. \n",
    "# Python uses a mechanism called exception handling to manage these errors gracefully. \n",
    "# This allows a program to respond to errors, recover from them, and continue execution.\n",
    "# Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when there is a problem with the syntax of the code itself.\n",
    "# This type of error is detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the code is even executed.\n",
    "# Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all because the code is not valid Python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Differences between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "# Timing of Occurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exceptions: Occur during the execution of the code. The code is syntactically correct but encounters an error while running.\n",
    "# Syntax Errors: Occur during the parsing of the code before it is executed. \n",
    "# The code is not valid Python syntax and hence cannot run at all.\n",
    "# Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exceptions: Can be caught and handled using try and except blocks. \n",
    "# This allows the program to manage errors and continue execution.\n",
    "# Syntax Errors: Cannot be caught or handled with exception handling mechanisms. \n",
    "# They must be corrected in the code before the program can run.\n",
    "# Nature of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exceptions: Typically relate to logical errors or problems that arise while the code is executing, such as dividing by zero,\n",
    "# accessing out-of-range indices, or file I/O errors.\n",
    "# Syntax Errors: Relate to incorrect code formatting or use of invalid syntax, such as missing colons, \n",
    "# mismatched parentheses, or incorrect indentation."

    "\n",
    "Why We Need Custom Exceptions\n",
    "Specificity: Custom exceptions allow you to define error conditions that are specific to your application's domain, which can make error handling more precise and understandable.\n",
    "Clarity: By defining custom exceptions, you can provide more meaningful names and messages for errors, making your code easier to debug and maintain.\n",
    "Control: Custom exceptions give you control over how errors are reported and handled in different parts of your application. This can be particularly useful in large projects or libraries where different components need to handle errors differently.\n",
    "How to Create and Use Custom Exceptions\n",
    "To create a custom exception in Python, you generally follow these steps:\n",
