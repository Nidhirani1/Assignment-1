    "# Class and Object in Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "# In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the concepts of class and object are fundamental building blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class:\n",
    "# A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. \n",
    "# It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have. \n",
    "# Classes encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. \n",
    "# They are used to create objects with specific properties and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Object:\n",
    "# An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, \n",
    "# no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created. \n",
    "# Each object has its own set of attributes and can use the methods defined in the class. \n",
    "# Objects represent real-world entities or concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Let's consider a real-world example of a \"Car\".\n",

    "# # Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "# Ans:-\n",
    "# 1>Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) together into a single unit,\n",
    "# known as a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, \n",
    "# which can protect the integrity of the data and hide the internal implementation details from the outside world. \n",
    "# This is typically achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2>Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and \n",
    "# showing only the necessary features of an object. It allows users to interact with the object \n",
    "# through a simplified interface. Abstraction helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "# It focuses on what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3>Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (called the child or subclass) can inherit properties and \n",
    "# behaviors (methods) from another class (called the parent or superclass). It promotes code reusability and \n",
    "# establishes a natural hierarchy between classes. For example, a Dog class can inherit from an Animal class, \n",
    "# meaning Dog would automatically have the properties and methods defined in Animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4>Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism means \"many shapes\" and it allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class\n",
    "# rather than their actual class. The most common use of polymorphism is when a parent class reference is\n",
    "# used to refer to a child class object. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding\n",
    "# (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism)."

    "# # Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "# Ans:-The __init__() Function in Python\n",
    "# The __init__() function is a special method in Python, commonly referred to as the constructor. \n",
    "# It is automatically called when a new instance of a class is created. The primary purpose of __init__() is\n",
    "# to initialize the object's attributes with user-defined values or default values. \n",
