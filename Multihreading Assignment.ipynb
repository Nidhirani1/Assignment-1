    "# Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "# Ans:-\n",
    "# Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of two or more threads within a single process. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process, and multithreading allows a program to perform multiple operations simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Multithreading is Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concurrency: Multithreading helps in running multiple tasks at the same time, which can improve the efficiency of certain applications, particularly those involving I/O operations or tasks that are inherently concurrent.\n",
    "# Responsiveness: In user-interface applications, multithreading can help keep the application responsive by performing background tasks without freezing the main application thread.\n",
    "# Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share memory and resources, making it easier to share data between tasks without needing complex inter-process communication mechanisms.\n",
    "# Module for Handling Threads:\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, the threading module is used to handle threads. It provides a way to create and manage threads, synchronize their execution, and handle thread-related tasks. Here's a simple example of how to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "# def worker():\n",
    "#     print(\"Thread is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Create a new thread\n",
    "# thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Start the thread\n",
    "# thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Wait for the thread to complete\n",

    "#  enumerate()\n",
    "# Ans:-The threading module in Python provides a way to work with threads, allowing you to create and manage threads in your programs. It is particularly useful for tasks that can benefit from concurrent execution, such as I/O-bound tasks, background processing, or applications that need to remain responsive.\n",

    "# Q3. Explain the following functions\n",
    "# ( run(\n",
    "#  start(\n",
    "#  join(\n",
    "# ' isAlive()\n",
    "# Ans:-In Python's threading module, the following functions are integral to thread management and control. Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. run()\n",
    "# Purpose: The run() method is defined in the Thread class and is intended to contain the code that will be executed by the thread. By default, this method calls the target function provided when creating the thread. If you subclass Thread, you can override this method to define the behavior of your thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# Copy code\n",
    "# import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "# class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "#     def run(self):\n",
    "#         print(\"Thread is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Create and start the thread\n",
    "# thread = MyThread()\n",
    "# thread.start()\n",
    "# Explanation: In this example, MyThread overrides the run() method to specify what should happen when the thread is started. When thread.start() is called, it internally calls the run() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. start()\n",
    "# Purpose: The start() method begins the thread’s activity. When you call start(), the thread is initialized and the run() method is invoked in a new thread of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# python\n",
    "# Copy code\n",
    "# import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "# def worker():\n",
    "#     print(\"Thread is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Create a thread\n",
    "# thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Start the thread\n",
    "# thread.start()\n",
    "# Explanation: Here, thread.start() initiates the thread and causes it to run the worker function. This method must be called to begin the thread’s execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. join()\n",
    "# Purpose: The join() method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. When you call join() on a thread, the calling thread (often the main thread) is blocked until the thread on which join() was called finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "# def worker():\n",
    "#     print(\"Thread is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Create and start the thread\n",
    "# thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "# thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Wait for the thread to finish\n",
    "# thread.join()\n",
    "# print(\"Thread has finished\")\n",
    "# Explanation: In this example, thread.join() blocks the main thread until the worker thread completes. This ensures that \"Thread has finished\" is printed only after the worker thread has completed its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. is_alive()\n",
    "# Purpose: The is_alive() method checks whether the thread is still alive (i.e., whether it has finished execution or not). It returns True if the thread is still running and False if it has finished or has not been started.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# import threading\n",
    "# import time\n",
    "\n",
    "# def worker():\n",
    "#     time.sleep(2)\n",
    "#     print(\"Thread has finished\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Create and start the thread\n",
    "# thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "# thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Check if the thread is alive\n",
    "# print(f\"Is thread alive? {thread.is_alive()}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Wait for the thread to complete\n",
    "# thread.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Check again if the thread is alive\n",
    "# print(f\"Is thread alive? {thread.is_alive()}\")\n",
    "# Explanation: Before calling join(), thread.is_alive() returns True because the thread is still running. After join() has been called and the thread completes, thread.is_alive() returns False"
