    "# Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves hiding the \n",

    "# It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "# Abstraction allows us to deal with objects at a higher level of complexity without worrying about the \n",

    "# Key Points:\n",
    "# Hiding Complexity: Abstraction hides the internal implementation details of an object and only exposes \n",
