    "# Q3. How do you convert one data type to another in Python?\n",
    "# Ans:-In Python, you can convert one data type to another using built-in functions or methods. \n",
    "# Here are some common conversion methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1>Implicit Conversion (Automatic Type Conversion): Python automatically converts data types in certain situations, \n",
    "# such as when performing arithmetic operations between different types. For example, \n",
    "# if you add an integer to a float, Python will automatically convert the integer to a float before performing \n",
    "# the addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# x = 5  # integer\n",
    "# y = 2.5  # float\n",
    "\n",
    "# result = x + y  # Python converts x to float before adding\n",
    "# print(result)  # Output: 7.5\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2>Explicit Conversion (Type Casting): You can explicitly convert one data type to another using built-in functions\n",
    "# like int(),float(), str(), list(), tuple(), set(), dict(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# # Converting to integer\n",

    "# y = int(\"10\")  # y will be 10\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Converting to float\n",
    "# a = float(5)  # a will be 5.0\n",
    "# b = float(\"3.14\")  # b will be 3.14\n",

    "# # Converting to string\n",
    "# s = str(10)  # s will be \"10\"\n",
    "# t = str(3.14)  # t will be \"3.14\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Converting to list\n",
    "# lst = list((1, 2, 3))  # lst will be [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Converting to tuple\n",
    "# tpl = tuple([1, 2, 3])  # tpl will be (1, 2, 3)\n",

    "# # Converting to set\n",
    "# st = set([1, 2, 2, 3])  # st will be {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Converting to dictionary\n",
    "# d = dict([(1, 'one'), (2, 'two')])  # d will be {1: 'one', 2: 'two'}\n",
